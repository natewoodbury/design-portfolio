      <p class="postwords">
        Brick is a real-estate startup focused on creating new opportunities for underserved real-estate markets. I led
        the development and design of three integrated products:</p>

      <p class="postwords">My Brick Offer - A consumer-facing platform for presenting and transacting real estate offers
        in clear concise
        terms. Featured an API integration with DocuSign and a messaging system to facilitate addendums.</p>

      <p class="postwords">Brick Kiln - An internal CRM platform for evaluating and underwriting real-estate properties.
        This featured
        integrations with DocuSign, 3rd Party analytics, and email API platforms. Also included features for inventory
        management, internal messaging, and project management tools.</p>

      <p class="postwords">Brick Marketplace - An informational product for displaying and browsing real estate
        currently held by Brick.
        Utilized e-commerce-like features as well as email marketing integrations.</p>

        Working for this client-based dev shop I had the opportunity to work in multiple industries and on different
        development projects including web, mobile, and enterprise software solutions.
      </p>


      <!-- <div class="postwords">
        <p> I interfaced with clients and projects across multiple industries including:

      <p class="postwords"> I worked with off-shore development teams spanning multiple time zones using Agile/Scrum
        methodologies. This
        included writing tickets, running Scrum ceremonies, and working with clients to build strategies for their
        products.</p>

      <p class="postwords"> My Nursing Education client at the time was experiencing unprecedented growth due to the
        pandemic and I was
        tasked with learning enough Azure Web Services to handle dev ops during developer off-hours. We successfully
        managed the 10x growth while continuing to build new modules and features.</p>

      <h2 class="titlepost">Biofire Defense</h2>
      <p class="postwords">
        Biofire Defense builds pathogen detection systems for local, state, and federal US agencies. These machines and
        the software that runs them are subject to stringent regulations that need to be navigated while attempting to
        build user-centric software. Due to the nature of these products, I am limited in the designs I am able to share
        publicly.</p>

      <p class="postwords">I was the lead designer for the core software update of The Razor Mk II detection system.
        This comprehensive
        effort involved initial sketches, in-depth research, and analysis sourced from our customer support department,
        culminating in the successful release of an updated system. The result was a notable reduction in user errors,
        coupled with enhanced safety and precision in system operation. A critical success when dealing with contagious
        pathogens.</p>

      <p class="postwords">Created user-centric web interfaces to visually present complex diagnostic data and
        analytics, enhancing
        nationwide awareness of pathogen trends and promoting data transparency.</p>
